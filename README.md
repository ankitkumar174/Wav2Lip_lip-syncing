# Wav2Lip_lip-syncing

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to effectively synchronize audio with video using Wav2Lip. By following this guide, you'll be able to create the illusion that the person in the video is speaking the audio. This skill can prove invaluable for a wide range of video editing and dubbing projects.

# Installation
Before you begin, you need to install the required software and dependencies:

1. FFmpeg-Python: A multimedia framework to handle video and audio.

2. Librosa: A Python package for audio analysis.

# Download Files
To proceed with the lip-syncing process, you should gather the essential files:

1. Model Checkpoint (.pth): Obtain the model checkpoint file by downloading it.

2. Video File: Secure the video in which you intend to synchronize the audio.

Once you have these files in your possession, you are ready to commence the lip-syncing process.


# Run the inference script with your files
```
!python inference.py \
        --checkpoint_path "checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth" \
        --segmentation_path "checkpoints/face_segmentation.pth" \
        --sr_path "checkpoints/esrgan_max.pth" \
        --face "videos/video_file.mp4" \
        --audio "videos/audio_file.mp4" \
        --outfile "results/final_output.mp4"
```
Replace /path/to/wav2lip.pth with the path to the downloaded model checkpoint, /path/to/video.mp4 with the path to the video file, and /path/to/audio.wav with the path to the audio file.
The script will generate an output video where the lip movements are synchronized with the provided audio.

Remember to adjust the file paths according to your system's directory structure.
